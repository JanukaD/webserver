   <p><h4> Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection. Server forms the listener socket while client reaches out to the server.
They are the real backbones behind web browsing. In simpler terms there is a server and a client.</h4></p>

<p><h4>Of the various forms of IPC, sockets are by far the most popular. On any given platform, there are likely to be other forms of IPC that are faster, but for cross-platform communication, sockets are about the only game in town.</h4></p>

<p><h4>They were invented in Berkeley as part of the BSD flavor of Unix. They spread like wildfire with the Internet. With good reason â€” the combination of sockets with INET makes talking to arbitrary machines around the world unbelievably easy (at least compared to other schemes).</h4></p>
